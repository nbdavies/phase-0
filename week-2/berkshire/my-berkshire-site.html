<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was fun and went pretty smoothly, though the end result quickly becomes not too pretty to look at.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	We may not have gotten as granular as possible with semantic tags, like wrapping random text in p-tags, or deciding what to call the last-modified-date stuff, etc.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We scratched the surface a little, and figured out that creating the two-columned list would have really been a table where each bullet would be in its own cell of the table. That was going to be a real pain, and we saw that it could also be done using CSS.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	It's pretty straightforward, but the resulting code isn't too pretty to look at. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Getting the structure in place first, and adding the individual links and stuff. Also, writing the closing tags for each pair before you start figuring out the attributes.
