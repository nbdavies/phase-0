User story
As a user, I want to be able to calculate the "sum" of a list of numbers.
I aslo want to be able to calculate the "median" of a list of numbers.
On top of that, I want to be able to calculate the "mean" (a.k.a. average) of a list of numbers.
These should all work whether my list has an even number of entries or not.

And a pony. Or at least some kind of gift made out of a pony (and not too many monkeys). Please and thank you.

/* 
Post-game Analysis
The "mean" function didn't make it into the final code, but the "sum" and "median" functions passed all their tests. 
We also made a pretty pony, which I had totally meant to just be a joke, but it's cool that it turned into something!
