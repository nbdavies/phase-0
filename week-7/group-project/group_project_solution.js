/*
As a user, I want to be able to calculate the "sum" of a list of numbers.
I aslo want to be able to calculate the "median" of a list of numbers.
On top of that, I want to be able to calculate the "mean" (a.k.a. average) of a list of numbers.
These should all work whether my list has an even number of entries or not.

And a pony. Or at least some kind of gift made out of a pony (and not too many monkeys). Please and thank you.
