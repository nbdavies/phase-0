What does puts do?

The "puts" command does two things:
1. It returns a value of nil.
2. It evaluates the argument you give it, and writes the value on a new line.

What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a positive or negative whole number. You can do all sorts of mathematical operations on one or more integer, and the result will always be expressed as an integer, even for division.
A float is a positive or negative number with a decimal included, even if it's something like "2.0". When you do mathematical operations on floats, the result will be a float as well.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division is what we would typically expect a computer to do. In cases like 1/3 for example, the result would be expressed as a decimal (0.3333333333333333).
For integer division, it returns only the integer portion of the result. 1/3 = 0 for example. It would be like if you were trying to divide up some number of things--pencils maybe--amongst a certain number of people, and if there's a remainder left over, that doesn't change how many pencils each person received.
